Title: Banking Management System (C++)

Description:

This is a console-based Banking Management System developed in C++ as part of my second semester university project. The application allows basic banking operations for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and loans. It uses procedural programming concepts and demonstrates switch-case based menu navigation.

ðŸ”§ Features:

Add and view customer details

Open and view bank accounts

Perform and track transactions

Manage loan information   

View records by ID or view all records

Simple command-line interface using do-while and switch-case structures

ðŸ“‚ Functions Included:

Add_Customers(), viewCustomer()

Add_Account(), ViewAccount()

View_All_Customers(), View_All_Accounts()

Perform_Transaction(), View_Transaction_By_ID(), View_All_Transactions()

Take_Loan(), View_Loan_By_ID(), View_All_Loans()

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of structured programming, and basic user interface design in C++.
